# CIS 192 Final Project

#### Project Members: Aryan Nagariya, Lorenzo Lucena, Bryan Yao

## Description

This Final Project consists of a web application that given credentials to Piazza and a class code, would provide a CloudWord and a Frequency Plot of the posts in a Piazza Class. We can divide the project in three components. First, the Piazza posts are extracted from the PIAZZA API, and desired information is retrieved. Secondly, we process the data, and utilizing the NLTK and WordCloud libraries, a Wordcloud and Frequency Plot PNG images are generated from the processed data. Thirdly, we display our information using Django onto a web application for our user to be able to access the tool through an interface and personalize their experience by introducing their own credentials.

## Code Structure

The assignment was divided among three team members according to the three stages mentioned earlier. The code consists of a file that accesses the information from Piazza, and another that processes and generates the content of our webpage, all incorporated to a Django Framework.
